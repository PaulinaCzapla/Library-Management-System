# Library Management System


Library Management System is a console program carried out using the assumptions of object-oriented programming in C++. 


**Project assumptions:**

- the library's resources are books, CDs and movies;
- the program is used to manage the resources of a specific library branch;
- resources can be borrowed between users and the library and between library branches;
- if the resource is not returned by the user on time, a fee will be charged;
- amount of the fee depends on the delay.

**Functionalities offered by the program:**
- borrowing resources to users/ other libraries;
- borrowing resources from another library branches;
- adding/ removing library users;
- adding/ removing resources;
- charging fees for delay;
- browsing, searching the resource database;
- browsing, searching the user database;
- browsing resources borrowed by the user;
- protection against incorrect data.


**Issues used in the project:**
- classes;
- inheritance;
- polymorphism;
- overloaded operators;
- streams / files;
- dynamic memory allocation, self-implemented dynamic data structure.
